# JARVIS_Voice_Assistant_system

JARVIS is a Python-based smart voice assistant designed to interact with users through natural speech. It uses speech recognition to understand commands and text-to-speech (TTS) to respond, creating a hands-free experience similar to Iron Man’s JARVIS.

The goal of this project is to build an intelligent, voice-controlled assistant that offers a seamless and interactive user experience inspired by the fictional JARVIS system.
